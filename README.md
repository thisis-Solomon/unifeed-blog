# Welcome to Codewell! ðŸ‘‹

Codewell's aim is to provide you with real-world design templates that you can use to practice your HTML and CSS projects. But for this project I've use the Sveltejs and Tailwindcss because I'm at trying to learn Tailwindcss and I've just gone through some couple of tutorial and documentation.

For this project, I'm not ending here, I want to link it with the second practice project and also to link it with Firebase as database and make it a real blog site for my tech tips and tuts.

### I've completed the challenge.

I have completed the challenge using Svelte and Tailwindcss and deployed the website on the following

- [Project Git Repo](https://github.com/thisis-Solomon/unifeed-blog)
- [Vercel](https://my-agency-ivory.vercel.app/)
